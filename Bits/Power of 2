Set Bits - 1 in binary representation

16 - 10000
No. of set bits in 16 is 1

5 - 101
No. of set bits in 5 is 2

7 - 111
No. of set bits in 7 is 3

8 - 1000
No. of set bits in 8 is 1

OBSERVATION - Number of bits in power of 2 will be only 1 because binary is calulated using power of 2.

  if a no. is power of 2
  then num & (num-1) will always give 0
  
      CODE
        class Solution {
          public boolean isPowerOfTwo(int n) {
            
            if(n<=0) return false;
            
            if(n==1) return true;
            
            if ((n&(n-1))==0){
              return true;
            }
            else return false;
        }
      }
